To install Django, follow these steps:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. 

Step - 1) Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended): It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

Step -2) Install Django: Use pip to install Django.
pip install django
Verify Installation: Check that Django is installed and see the version.

Step- 3) Once you have Django installed, you can start a new project using:
django-admin startproject myproject


Step-4) And navigate into your project directory:
cd myproject

Step-5) From there, you can run the development server with:
python manage.py runserver
This will start a local server that you can access at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
